You're a professional riddle and puzzle producer who specialises in cryptic word games, riddles, limericks, haikus, and treasure hunts. I'm interested in creating a treasure hunt around a city based on specific place names that uses clues from the place name to create a cryptic clue that players use to find the location. Create a cryptic clue for each of the locations in the following list of places in Melbourne Australia. The clues should be around 30 to 50 words each and include words and synonyms associated with the location name but not include the location name itself. Before you continue confirm you understand the complete assignment

A Little Joy
A star aligns off Chinatown where tiny sparks of happiness await in this tucked-away haven of no big sorrow

Cathy's Hot Pot (Laoliuzhou Noodle) 
Sutherland and Little Lonsdale hide this Filipino feast. 

See the large male lumbering across the savannah? He's enjoying a basically seasoned midday meal to the east. Head north from his lunch spot and find her. 

Fuwa Kakigori (stop) 
The 30 rolls from Docklands past Queen like fluffy Japanese shaved ice. 

Borek Bakehouse
Mark it like a Queen and follow the flaky layers from the Ottoman silk road to this house of oven baked goods

Dolan Uyghur
Readings Emporium - find book on Qing Dynasty and align image to reveal directions to Dolan 

An ancient tribe in the Taklamakan Desert during the Qing Dynasty cooked amazing meats and rocked some serious hardware. Ask Timothy. 

Martabak Pecenongan
Fluffy or crispy? This dish from bustling Indonesian streets stacks up sweets and treats. Seek a piece of Jakarta in a stack of pancake layers—you’ll recognize the smell of fried goodness.

Nasi Lemak
Where fragrant rice mingles with sambal heat, coconut’s essence rises like morning fog. Think breakfast or feast, wrapped like a gift from the heart of Southeast Asia.

Good Measure
Seek balance here, where pours are precise and flavors mingle just right. A space to measure moments—whether a sip, a chat, or a careful blend, it’s where just enough becomes perfect.

Heartattack and Vine
Cardiovascular Tarzan Failure 
Find a word puzzle? 

Bahama Gold
Where sands shimmer like metal jewellery in Caribbean warmth, seek this Lygon spot for a much needed break. 


CBCB
A double name for those who seek crunch and warmth. It’s crispy, warm, and where bundles of joy are crafted just for you—an abbreviation hiding its full flavor.

Double up to (almost) reveal this place that shines like a kristal in hilly 1970s Manhattan.

In the 1970s, Einstein stood and viewed Manhattanhenge while it was probably still all country. Was it hilly? Or blues? Double up to (almost) reveal this place. 

Tofu Shoten
Silken squares and golden fried secrets await in this minimalist spot. From bean to curd, it’s where the humble soy transforms.

North of Brunswick off Sydney, a bookstore from the far east specialising in silken soy squares and bean curd.


Plus Coffee
Add coffee to water and get yourself a brew so good it's the opposite of subtraction.

Add one block up to the late Queen off centre and you're a third of the way there for this positive coffee stop.
